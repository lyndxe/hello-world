# hello-world

hi everyone!

i'm lyndxe, and i'm revisiting the coding world. i started using HTML to make websites way back in 1997 on my WebTV (oof - anyone remember that?!).  i eventually graduated to a PC, and from there honed my skills even further, making websites for friends and neighborhood businesses. i remember teaching myself to make an "animated rollover image" that would change when you moved your cursor over it.  that was a huge moment for me!  from there, i started learning javascript and VB, scrawling various code scribbles into my college-ruled notebook, but by the early 2000s, i decided to move on to other ventures and left my coding days behind. i've now come back to revisit my early days, nearly 15 years later and hopefully try and pick back up where i left off, now as an ecology PhD student.  this should be a unique and fun adventure for me, so keep your fingers crossed!  oh, and i also love cacti, cats, cameras, and chai tea.  so coding should fit in just fine there! :)
