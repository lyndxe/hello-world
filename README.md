# hello-world

hi everyone!

i'm lyndxe, and i'm revisiting the coding world. i started using HTML to make websites way back in 1997 on my WebTV!  i eventually graduated to a PC, and from there honed my skills even further, making websites for friends and neighborhood businesses. i started learning javascript and VB, but by the early 2000s, i decided to move on to other ventures and left my coding days behind. since then, i've decided to revist it now, nearly 15 years later and hopefully try and pick back up where i left off.  this should be a unique and fun adventure for me, so keep your fingers crossed!  oh, and i also love cactus, cats, and chai tea.  so coding should fit in just fine there :)
